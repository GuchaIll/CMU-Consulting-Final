      <p>Students in the Information Systems Consulting Project course collaborate with community-based organizations to
        develop useful information system solutions to meet real management needs. Real world client partnerships are an
        important part of the program's educational mission, giving students and project sponsors a significant
        opportunity to work together towards a common goal. Typically, our project partners represent non-profit or
        charitable organizations, often engaged in missions that benefit the community in significant ways. </p>

      <h3 class="becpart">Benefits</h3>
      <p> Student Consultants work, as a team, with community partners throughout the semester to identify, plan, and
        implement ways in which technology can help the organization better fulfill its mission. Teams act as
        consultants
        working 'with' and not 'for' their project clients. At the completion of the project, each team must provide a
        sustainable solution that fits the client's objectives, organization constraints and capabilities. </p>

      <h3 class="becpart">Expectations</h3>
      <p> There is no fee to participate, but organizations must invest significant time and effort during the
        semester-long partnership to achieve sustainable technology improvements.
